# try-git-3

This project started as a result of me finding it difficult to merge my branches after working on my machine first before creating a remote repository.
so I decided to create a remote repo first with this project to understand step by step what is going on with my remote repository. I just want to learn git so well once and for all.
I tried pushing forgetting that I missed the commit step..and I figured that I had nothing to push because I committed nothing.
